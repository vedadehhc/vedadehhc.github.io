I'm a third-year undergraduate student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My current interests (research and industry) are in energy efficient software and hardware systems, parallel algorithms, and next-gen computing systems for AI. My previous projects are somwehat diverse in their methods and applications, and you can view most of my prior work [here](/projects).

If you're intersted in chatting (either virtually or in-person), feel free to reach out to me at [dchheda@mit.edu](mailto:dchheda@mit.edu)! I'm always interested in meeting people from different backgrounds and expertise, and I'm open to any new collaborations, or just connecting.
