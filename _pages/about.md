I'm a third-year undergraduate student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My previous projects are somwehat diverse in their methods and applications, and you can view most of my prior work [here](/projects).

Most recently, I'm building Devin, the world's first AI software engineer, at [Cognition](cognition.ai).

If you're interested in chatting (either virtually or in-person), feel free to reach out to me at [dchheda@mit.edu](mailto:dchheda@mit.edu)! I'm always interested in meeting people from different backgrounds and expertise, and I'm open to any new collaborations, or just connecting.
