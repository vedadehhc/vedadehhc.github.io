Most recently, I'm building Devin, the world's first AI software engineer, at [Cognition](https://cognition.ai). This work is at the forefront of AI and software engineering, and it represents the primary focus of my current professional endeavors.

Previously, I have worked on a variety of projects during my time as an undergraduate student at MIT, where I study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My projects have been diverse in their methods and applications, and you can view most of my prior work [here](/projects).

If you're interested in chatting (either virtually or in-person), feel free to reach out to me at [devmchheda@gmail.com](mailto:devmchheda@gmail.com)! I'm always interested in meeting people from different backgrounds and expertise, and I'm open to any new collaborations, or just connecting.
